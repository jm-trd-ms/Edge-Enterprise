### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Stable channel release. The following Dev notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 131.0.2863.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/edgeinsiderannouncements/dev-channel-update-to-131-0-2863-0-is-live-/4260359)
- [Dev Channel update to 131.0.2875.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/edgeinsiderannouncements/dev-channel-update-to-131-0-2875-0-is-live-/4267839)
- [Dev Channel update to 131.0.2889.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/edgeinsiderannouncements/dev-channel-update-to-131-0-2889-0-is-live-/4273465)
- [Dev Channel update to 131.0.2903.5 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/edgeinsiderannouncements/dev-channel-update-to-131-0-2903-5-is-live-/4277981)

### Feature updates

- **Cancel dialog for `beforeunload` event.** Microsoft Edge changed the behavior of the cancel dialog for the `beforeunload` event. Calling `event.preventDefault` in a `beforeunload` event handler won't prevent the dialog from being shown. Instead, `event.returnValue = ''` needs to be called in the `beforeunload` event handler to prevent the cancel dialog. The [BeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies?branch=main#beforeunloadeventcancelbypreventdefaultenabled) policy is obsolete and no longer works after Microsoft Edge version 130.

- **Changes to Kyber.** The Kyber algorithm was standardized with minor technical changes and renamed to the Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM). ML-KEM is implemented in the BoringSSL cryptography library, which allows for it to be deployed and utilized by services that depend on this library.

  The changes to the final version of ML-KEM make it incompatible with the previously deployed version of Kyber. Due to this incompatibility the following changes in Microsoft Edge will be made:

  - Edge switches from supporting Kyber to ML-KEM.
  - Edge offers a key share prediction for hybrid ML-KEM (codepoint 0x11EC).
  - The `PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled` flag and the [PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#postquantumkeyagreementenabled) policy applies to Kyber and ML-KEM. Note: The [PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#postquantumkeyagreementenabled) policy is scheduled for removal in Edge version 141.
  - Edge will no longer support hybrid Kyber (codepoint 0x6399).

### Policy updates

#### New policies

- [EdgeSidebarAppUrlHostAllowList](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgesidebarappurlhostallowlist) - Allow specific apps to be opened in Microsoft Edge sidebar
- [PrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#privatenetworkaccessrestrictionsenabled) - Specifies whether to apply restrictions to requests to more private network endpoints

#### Deprecated policies

- [NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehaviorAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#newbaseurlinheritancebehaviorallowed) - Allows enabling the feature NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehavior (deprecated)
- [RSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#rsakeyusageforlocalanchorsenabled) - Check RSA key usage for server certificates issued by local trust anchors (deprecated)
- [UserAgentClientHintsGREASEUpdateEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#useragentclienthintsgreaseupdateenabled) - Control the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature (deprecated)

#### Obsoleted policies

- [BeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#beforeunloadeventcancelbypreventdefaultenabled) - Control the behavior for the cancel dialog produced by the beforeunload event (obsolete)
- [SignInCtaOnNtpEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#signinctaonntpenabled) - Enable sign in click to action dialog (obsolete)

### Site compatibility impacting changes

- **CSS Anchor Positioning: `anchor-scope`.** The `anchor-scope` property allows limiting the visibility of anchor names to a given subtree.

- **CSS `font-variant-emoji`.** The `font-variant-emoji` CSS property provides a way to control between colored (emoji-style) and monochromatic (text-style) emoji glyphs. This method can be also done by adding an emoji Variation Selector, specifically U+FE0E for text and U+FE0F for emoji, after each emoji codepoint.

- **CSS highlight inheritance.** With CSS highlight inheritance, the CSS highlight pseudo-classes, such as `::selection` and `::highlight`, inherit their properties through the pseudo highlight chain, rather than the element chain. The result is a more intuitive model for inheritance of properties in highlights.

- **Improvements to styling structure of `<details>` and `<summary>` elements.** Support more CSS styling for the structure of `<details>` and `<summary>` elements to allow these elements to be used in more cases where disclosure widgets or accordion widgets are built on the web. In particular, this change removes restrictions that prevented setting the display property on these elements, and adds a `::details-content` pseudo-element to style the container for the part that expands and collapses.

- **`@page` margin boxes.** Add support for page margin boxes, when printing a web document, or exporting it as PDF.

  The `@page` margin boxes let you define the contents in the margin area of a page, for example to provide custom headers and footers, rather than using the built-in headers and footers generated by the browser.

  A margin box is defined using an at-rule inside a CSS `@page` rule. The appearance and the contents of a margin box are specified with CSS properties inside the `@page` rule, including the `content` property. Counters are also supported, for page numbering. The specification defines two special counter names: `page` for the current page number and `pages` for the total number of pages.

- **@property support `<string>` syntax.** Support for `<string>` syntax component name for registered custom properties.

- **Support `currentcolor` in relative color syntax.** Allow relative colors in CSS (using the `from` keyword) to use `currentcolor` as a base. This support lets you set complementary colors, based on an element's text color, for that element's borders, shadows, or backgrounds.

  This feature also includes use cases where color functions are nested with a dependency on `currentcolor`, for example: `color-mix (in srgb, rgb(from currentcolor r g b), white)) or rgb(from rgb(from currentcolor 1 g b) b g r)`.

- **Support external SVG resources for `clip-path`, `fill`, `stroke`, and `marker-*` properties.** This feature adds support for external references for clip paths, markers, and paint servers (for the `fill` and `stroke` properties). For example, `clip-path: url("resources.svg#myPath")`.

- **Direct Sockets API.** Allows Isolated Web Apps to establish direct transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP) communications with network devices and systems as well as listen to and accept incoming connections.

- **Exempt `Speculation-Rules` header from CSP restrictions.** Updates the integration between speculation rules and CSP so that CSP only applies to `<script type=speculationrules>`, and not to the `Speculation-Rules` header. CSP's script policies are meant to protect against injection of scripts into HTML, and the CSP threat model doesn't relate to HTTP headers. This approach allows easier deployment of speculation rules from CDNs and other edge servers.

- **FedCM as a trust signal for the Storage Access API.** Reconciles the FedCM and Storage Access APIs by making a prior FedCM grant a valid reason to automatically approve a storage access request.

  When a user grants permission to use their identity with a third-party identity provider (IdP) on a relying party (RP), many IdPs require third-party cookies to function correctly and securely. This proposal aims to satisfy that requirement in a private and secure manner by updating the Storage Access API (SAA) permission checks to not only accept the permission grant given by a storage access prompt, but also the permission grant given by a FedCM prompt.

  A key property of this mechanism is limiting the grant to cases explicitly allowed by the RP with the FedCM permissions policy, enforcing a per-frame control for the RP and preventing passive surveillance by the IdP beyond the capabilities that FedCM already grants.

- **COOP value `noopener-allow-popups`.** Some origins can contain different applications with different levels of security requirements. In those cases, it can be beneficial to prevent scripts running in one application from being able to open and script pages of another same-origin application.

  In such cases, it can be beneficial for a document to ensure its opener can't script it, even if the opener document is a same-origin one. The `noopener-allow-popups` Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy value lets documents define that behavior.

- **Select parser relaxation.** This change makes the HTML parser allow more tags in `<select>` besides `<option>`, `<optgroup>`, and `<hr>`.

  This change is in support of the customizable `<select>` feature but is being shipped first because it can be done separately and has some compat risk.

- **WebGPU: Clip distances.** Adds the optional GPU feature `clip-distances` that allows setting user-defined clip distances in vertex shader outputs. This technique is useful for the applications that need to clip all vertices in a scene that are beyond a user-defined plane, such as many CAD applications.

- **WebGPU: `GPUCanvasContext getConfiguration()`**. Once `GPUCanvasContext configure()` is called with a configuration dictionary, the `GPUCanvasContext getConfiguration()` method can be used to check the canvas context configuration. It includes GPU `device`, `format`, `usage`, `viewFormats`, `colorSpace`, `toneMapping`, and `alphaMode` members. As discussed in [issue 4828](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4828), web apps can use it to detect whether HDR canvas is supported in WebGPU.

- **WebHID on dedicated workers.** Enables WebHID inside dedicated worker contexts. This lets the performance of heavy I/O and processing of data from a HID device on a separate thread, helping to reduce the performance impact on the main thread.

- **WebRTC `RTCRtpEncodingParameters.scaleResolutionDownTo`.** An API that configures WebRTC encoders to scale input frames if they're greater than the specified `maxWidth` and `maxHeight`. This API is similar to `scaleResolutionDownBy` except that resolution constraints are expressed in absolute terms (for example, 640x360) as opposed to relative terms (for example, scale down by 2), avoiding race conditions related to changing input frame size on the fly.

- **Remove the CSS Anchor Positioning property `inset-area`.** With the CSS Working Group resolution on renaming the `inset-area` property to `position-area`, this removal cleans up the implementation for a standards compliant feature.

- **Remove non-standard GPUAdapter `requestAdapterInfo()` method.** The WebGPU Working Group decided it was impractical for `requestAdapterInfo()` to trigger a permission prompt so they removed that option and replaced it with the GPUAdapter `info` attribute so that web developers can get the same `GPUAdapterInfo` value synchronously.

### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Stable channel release. The following Dev notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2808.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2808-0-is-live/m-p/4237117)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2821.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2821-1-is-live/m-p/4242634)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2835.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2835-2-is-live/m-p/4250520)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2849.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2849-1-is-live/m-p/4255515)

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that prevented the briefcase icon from appearing on the *edge://settings/sidebar* page when Edge Bar was disabled using the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled) policy.

- Fixed an issue that caused rendering issues on some SharePoint sites.

- Fixed an issue where a "Can't update Microsoft Edge" dialog was mistakenly shown for managed Windows devices.

### Announcements

- **Live Captions.** The [LiveCaptionsAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#livecaptionsallowed) policy was available since Microsoft Edge version 103 but this feature isn't generally available. Clients that have the [ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#experimentationandconfigurationservicecontrol) policy set to 'FullMode' might receive the feature before broad availability. Broad availability will be announced via Microsoft Edge release notes.

- **Cancel dialog for `beforeunload` event.** Microsoft Edge is changing the behavior of the cancel dialog for the `beforeunload` event in Microsoft Edge version 131. Starting in version 131, calling `event.preventDefault` in a `beforeunload` event handler won't prevent the dialog from being shown. Instead, `event.returnValue = ''` needs to be called in the `beforeunload` event handler to prevent the cancel dialog. The [BeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#beforeunloadeventcancelbypreventdefaultenabled) policy is being obsoleted and will no longer work after Microsoft Edge version 130.

### Feature updates

- **Token Binding.** Token Binding uses cryptographic certificates on both ends of the TLS connection in an attempt to close the security gap of bearer tokens, which might be lost or stolen. Token Binding is deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 130. Also, the [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy is now obsolete.

- **Copilot browser Context Policies.** The [EdgeEntraCopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgeentracopilotpagecontext) policy will be available starting from Microsoft Edge version 130 and will replace the [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) policy. The [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) policy is deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 130 and will be obsolete in Edge 133.

- **Elevating top settings and improving settings page navigability.** To make finding browser settings more efficient, Microsoft Edge is introducing three navigation improvements to Edge Settings. We aren’t changing the functionality of any setting, and all the settings stay on the same page as they are today but are behind clickable sections. These changes are as follows.

  - Introduce quick access to the most used Settings actions on the first place users land when entering Edge Settings (the Profiles page). Clicking the button with the name of the setting navigates users directly to its location.

  - Make densely populated Settings pages (such as *Privacy, search, and services*, *Appearance*, *Cookies and site permissions*, *System and performance*) easier to navigate by introducing quick access to the most used actions located on that page. Clicking the button with the name of the setting takes users directly to its location.

  - For these densely populated pages, each lengthy section of settings will be a clickable "table of contents" with descriptive subtexts. This helps users locate settings directly and avoid unnecessary scrolling.

  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Edge on macOS now seamlessly opens links in Teams.** When Microsoft Edge is configured as the browser to open web links in Teams, then links in Teams chat will be opened through Edge, and Edge launches in the profile that matches with the authenticated profile, users can benefit from a seamless browsing experience that integrates their identity and user data across Microsoft apps. Administrators can control the availability of this feature using the "Choose Which Browser Opens Web Links" Microsoft 365 policy. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Site compatibility impacting changes

- **Compression dictionary transport with shared Brotli and shared Zstandard.** This feature adds support for using designated previous responses, as an external dictionary for content encoding compressing responses with Brotli or Zstandard.

  Enterprises might experience potential compatibility issues with enterprise network infrastructure that intercepts HTTPS traffic and is sensitive to unknown content encodings. The [CompressionDictionaryTransportEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#compressiondictionarytransportenabled) policy is available to turn off the compression dictionary transport feature.

- **Keyboard focusable scroll containers.** This feature improves accessibility by making scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation. Today, the tab key doesn't focus scrollers unless tabIndex is explicitly set to 0 or more.

  By making scrollers focusable by default, users without a mouse can now focus clipped content using tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard-focusable children. This logic is necessary so there are no regressions for existing focusable elements that might exist within a scroller like a \<textarea\>.

  If more time is needed to adjust to this new feature, the [KeyboardFocusableScrollersEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#keyboardfocusablescrollersenabled) policy is available from Edge 128.

- **Support non-special scheme URLs.** [Non-special scheme URLs](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#is-special) are now supported, for example, *git://example.com/path*. Previously, the URL parser didn't support non-special URLs. The parser parses non-special URLs as if they had an opaque path, which is not aligned with the URL standard. Now, the URL parser parses non-special URLs correctly, following the URL standard. For more details, see [http://bit.ly/url-non-special](http://bit.ly/url-non-special).

### Policy updates

#### New policies

- [EdgeEntraCopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgeentracopilotpagecontext) - Control access to page content for Entra ID Profiles accessing Microsoft Copilot with Enterprise Data Protection (EDP) from the Microsoft Edge sidebar

### Fixes

- **Policy updates to allow wildcards.** The documentation for the following policies were inaccurate and were corrected. These policies support wildcards (*) in URL patterns when being configured: [ImagesAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#imagesallowedforurls), [ImagesBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#imagesblockedforurls), [InsecureContentAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecurecontentallowedforurls), [InsecureContentBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecurecontentblockedforurls), [PopupsAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#popupsallowedforurls), [PopupsBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#popupsblockedforurls).

### Feature updates

- **Update to Microsoft Edge supported operating systems.** The minimum supported macOS version is increased to macOS 11. Users on older versions of macOS will no longer receive Microsoft Edge updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Deprecation of the CryptoWallet feature.** To improve end user experience, the CryptoWallet feature and the [CryptoWalletEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cryptowalletenabled) policy is deprecated. The [CryptoWalletEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cryptowalletenabled) policy will be obsolete in an upcoming release.

### Site compatibility impacting changes

- **Deprecation of non-standard declarative shadow DOM serialization.** The prototype implementation, which shipped in 2020 and then updated in 2023, contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` that could be used to serialize DOM trees containing shadow roots. That part of the prototype wasn't standardized with the rest of the declarative shadow DOM, and has only recently reached spec consensus (for details, see [GitHub](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/8867). As part of that consensus, the shape of the `getInnerHTML` API changed.

- **Deprecate the includeShadowRoots argument on DOMParser.** The `includeShadowRoots` argument was a never-standardized argument to the `DOMParser.parseFromString()` function, which was there to allow imperative parsing of HTML content that contains declarative shadow DOM. This function was shipped as part of the initial shipment of declarative shadow DOM. Since the standards discussion rematerialized in 2023, the shape of DSD APIs changed, including this feature for imperative parsing.

  Now that a standardized version of this API, in the form of `setHTMLUnsafe()` and `parseHTMLUnsafe()` shipped, the non-standard `includeShadowRoots` argument needs to be deprecated and removed. All usage should shift accordingly:

  Instead of:

  `(new DOMParser()).parseFromString(html,'text/html',{includeShadowRoots: true});`

  This can be used instead:

  `document.parseHTMLUnsafe(html);`

- **Rename inset-area to position-area**. The CSS working group ([CSSWG](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css/)) resolved to rename this property from `inset-area` to `position-area`. For more information, see the CSSWG discussion in [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10209#issuecomment-2221005001).

  The old and new property names are supported for a few milestones, to help developers migrate to the new position-area name. We're shipping the new property name, `position-area`, as a synonym for `inset-area`.

  The `inset-area` property is currently planned for removal in Microsoft Edge version 131.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused high CPU usage of renderer processes when running Selenium tests and calling `driver.quit()` to end the testing session.

### Feature updates

- **SSE3 Requirement.**  Microsoft Edge stopped supporting CPUs that lack SSE3. Devices with such CPUs won't receive any more updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Copilot browser Context Policies.** The [DiscoverPageContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#discoverpagecontextenabled) policy is obsoleted in Microsoft Edge version 128 and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 127.

  To summarize and answer questions based on browser context in Microsoft Edge, Copilot needs to be able to access the browser context. We're providing two new policies to offer more flexibility for admins to customize Edge browser context access across Copilot chats in Edge sidebar.

  - [CopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotpagecontext) - Control Copilot access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.
  - [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) - Control Copilot with Commercial Data Protection access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.

- **Deprecation of the followable web feature.** To improve end user experience, the followable web feature is deprecated. The [EdgeFollowEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgefollowenabled) policy is also obsolete.

- **EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled policy obsoletion.** The [EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enforcelocalanchorconstraintsenabled) policy was previously deprecated and is now obsolete in Edge version 128. Since Microsoft Edge 112, constraints in certificates loaded from the platform certificate store are enforced. The [EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enforcelocalanchorconstraintsenabled) policy existed as a temporary opt-out in case an enterprise encountered issues with the constraints encoded in their private roots.

- **New Policy for Insecure Downloads over HTTP.** Users that download potentially dangerous content on HTTP sites will receive a UI warning in a future Microsoft Edge version. To prepare for this change, the [ShowDownloadsInsecureWarningsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#showdownloadsinsecurewarningsenabled) policy is now available for admins to enable or disable the warnings related to insecure downloads

- **Edge Bar improvements.** Edge Bar, the detachable version of the Edge sidebar in Windows 10, has a changed entry point from the gear icon at the bottom of the Edge sidebar's fly out menu to the *edge://settings/sidebar* page.  

  For Windows 11 and Windows 10 users, clicking the gear icon will now automatically open the *edge://settings/sidebar* page.

  Also, the ability for Edge Bar to start automatically when starting a Windows 10 device has been enabled again, the Close "X" icon has been moved below the ellipsis menu at the bottom right corner of Edge Bar, and Copilot in Edge will remain within the browser not in Edge Bar. **Note:** These features are a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see these features, check back as we continue our rollout.

  Disabling Edge Bar through the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled) policy continues to work, there's a fix to make the UI and briefcase icon appear on the *edge://settings/sidebar* page coming soon.
