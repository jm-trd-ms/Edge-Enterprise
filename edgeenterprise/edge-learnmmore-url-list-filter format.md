# Filter format for URL list-based policies

This article describes the filter format used for the Microsoft Edge URL list-based policies For example, [URLBlocklist](microsoft-edge-policies.md#urlblocklist), [URLAllowList](microsoft-edge-policies.md#urlallowlist), and [CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls](microsoft-edge-policies.md#certificatetransparencyenforcementdisabledforurls) policies.

## The filter format

The filter format is:

```
    [scheme://][.]host[:port][/path][@query]
```

The fields in the filter format are:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **scheme** (*optional*) | It can be http://, https://, ftp://, edge://, etc. |
| **host** (*required*) | It must be a valid host name and you can use a wildcard ("\*"). To disable subdomain matching, include an optional dot (.) before **host**. A single IP Address Literal hostname may be specified, but wildcarding isn't supported for an IP Address Literal hostname. |
| **port** (*optional*) | Valid values range from 1 to 65535. |
| **path** (*optional*) | You can use any string in the path. |
| **query** (*optional*) | The **query** is either key-value or key-only tokens separated by an ampersand ("&"). Separate key-value tokens with an equal sign ("="). To indicate a prefix match, you can use an asterisk ("\*") at the end of the **query**. |

## Comparing the filter format to the URL format

The filter format resembles the URL format, except for the following differences:

- If you include "user:pass" in the format, it's ignored. For example, http://user:pass@ftp.contoso.com/pub/example.iso.
- If you include a fragment identifier ("#"), it and everything that follows the identifier is ignored.
- You can use a wildcard ("*") as the **host** and you can prefix it with a dot (.).
- You can use a forward slash ("/") or a dot (.) as a suffix for the **host**. In this case, the suffix is ignored.

## Filter selection criteria

The filter selected for a URL is the most specific match found after processing the following filter selection rules:

1. Filters with the longest **host** match are selected first.
2. From the selected filters, any filter with a scheme or port that doesn't match is discarded.
3. From the remaining filters, the filter with the longest matching **path** is selected.
4. From the remaining filters, the filter with the longest set of query tokens is selected. At this step, the allowlist filter takes precedence over the blocklist filter if both filters have the same **path** length and number of **query** tokens.
5. If there's no valid filter remaining, then the left-most subdomain is removed from **host** and the selection process starts over at step 1. The special asterisk ("*") **host** is the last searched and it matches all hosts.
6. If a filter's available, it blocks or allows the URL request.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The default behavior is to allow the URL request if no filter is matched.

## Example filter selection criteria

In this example, when searching for a match to "https://sub.contoso.com/docs" the filter selection will:

1. Search for a filter for `sub.contoso.com`. If it finds a filter, the search moves to step 2. If a filter isn't found, then it tries again with `contoso.com`, `com`, and finally " ".
2. From the selected filters, any that don't have "http" in the **scheme** are removed.
3. From the remaining filters, any that have an exact port number that isn't "80" are removed.
4. From the remaining filters, any that don't have "/docs" as a prefix of the **path** are removed.
5. From the remaining filters, the filter with the longest path prefix is selected and applied. If a filter isn't found, the selection process starts over again at step 1. The process is repeated with the next subdomain.

### More filter information

If a filter has a dot (".") prefixing the **host** then only exact **host** matches are filtered. For example:

- `contoso.com` (no dot) matches `contoso.com`, `www.contoso.com`, and `sub.www.contoso.com`
- `.www.contoso.com` (with a dot prefix) only matches `www.contoso.com`

You can use either a standard or custom **schema**. Supported standard schemas include:

- _about_, _blob_, _content_, _edge_, _cid_, _data_, _file_, _filesystem_, _ftp_, _gopher_, _http_, _https_, _javascript_, _mailto_, _ws_, and _wss_.

Any other **schema** is treated as a custom **schema**, but only the _schema:*_ and _schema://*_ patterns are allowed. For example:

- "custom:\*" or "custom://\*" match "custom:app"
- "custom:app" or "custom://app" are invalid

**schema** and **host** aren't case-sensitive. For example:

- `http://contoso.com` filter matches `HTTP://contoso.com`, `http://contoso.COM`, and `http://contoso.com`

**path** and **query** are case-sensitive. For example:

- `http://contoso.com/path?query=A` filter doesn't match `http://contoso.com/Path?query=A` or `http://contoso.com/path?Query=A`. It does match `http://contoso.COM/path?query=A`.
