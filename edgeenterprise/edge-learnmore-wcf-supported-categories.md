# Supported categories for Web Content Filtering

This article describes how web content is categorized and lists the categories that are currently supported.

## Introduction

 Proprietary categorization technology and processes are used to categorize websites, IPs, and detect anonymous proxy use in real-time. Coupled with machine learning-driven AI, our automated technology is context aware through comprehensive sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and topic modeling. Over 250 content analysis engines review text (in more than 200 languages) and images for URL categorization. Worldwide human review teams also perform physical website inspections to ensure accuracy and cultural relevance.
