# Regular Expression 2 (re2.h) syntax

Regular expressions are a notation for describing sets of character strings. When a string is in the set described by a regular expression, we say that the regular expression *matches* the string.

The simplest regular expression is a single literal character. Except for the metacharacters like `*+?()|`, characters match themselves. To match a metacharacter, escape it with a backslash. For example, `\+` matches the literal plus character.

Two regular expressions can be altered or concatenated to form a new regular expression: if *e<sub>1</sub>* matches _s_ and *e<sub>2</sub>* matches _t_, then *e<sub>1</sub>* | *e<sub>2</sub>* matches _s_ or _t_, and *e<sub>1</sub>* *e<sub>2</sub>*  matches _st_.

The metacharacters `*`, `+`, and `?` are repetition operators: *e<sub>1</sub>* `*` matches a sequence of zero or more (possibly different) strings, each of which match *e<sub>1</sub>*; *e<sub>1</sub>* `+` matches one or more; *e<sub>1</sub>* `?` matches zero or one.

Operator precedence, from weakest to strongest binding, is as follows:

- alternation
- concatenation
- repetition operators

Explicit parentheses can be used to force different meanings, as in arithmetic expressions. Some examples: `ab|cd` is equivalent to `(ab)|(cd)` ; `ab\` is equivalent to `a(b\)`.

The syntax described so far is most of the traditional Unix _egrep_ regular expression syntax. This subset suffices to describe all regular languages. A regular language is a set of strings that can be matched in a single pass through the text using only a fixed amount of memory. Newer regular expression facilities (notably Perl and those languages that have copied it) have added many new operators and escape sequences. These changes make the regular expressions more concise, and sometimes more cryptic, but not more powerful.

This page lists the regular expression syntax accepted by RE2.

It also lists some syntax accepted by PCRE, PERL, and VIM.

## Syntax tables

| Kinds of single-character expressions | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| any character, possibly including newline (s=true) | . |
| character class | [xyz] |
| negated character class | [^xyz] |
| Perl character class ([link](#user-content-perl)) | \d |
| negated Perl character class | \D |
| ASCII character class ([link](#user-content-ascii)) | [[:alpha:]] |
| negated ASCII character class | [[:^alpha:]] |
| Unicode character class (one-letter name) | \pN |
| Unicode character class | \p{Greek} |
| negated Unicode character class (one-letter name) | \PN |
| negated Unicode character class | \P{Greek} |

|&nbsp;| Composites |
| --- | --- |
| xy | x followed by y |
| x\|y | x or y (prefer x) |

|&nbsp;| Repetitions |
| --- | --- |
| x\* | zero or more x, prefer more |
| x+ | one or more x, prefer more |
| x? | zero or one x, prefer one |
| x{n,m} | n or n+1 or ... or m x, prefer more |
| x{n,} | n or more x, prefer more |
| x{n} | exactly n x |
| x\*? | zero or more x, prefer fewer |
| x+? | one or more x, prefer fewer |
| x?? | zero or one x, prefer zero |
| x{n,m}? | n or n+1 or ... or m x, prefer fewer |
| x{n,}? | n or more x, prefer fewer |
| x{n}? | exactly n x |
| x{} | (≡ x\*) (NOT SUPPORTED) VIM |
| x{-} | (≡ x\*?) (NOT SUPPORTED) VIM |
| x{-n} | (≡ x{n}?) (NOT SUPPORTED) VIM |
| x= | (≡ x?) (NOT SUPPORTED) VIM |

Implementation restriction: The counting forms `x{n,m}`, `x{n,}`, and `x{n}` reject forms that create a minimum or maximum repetition count above 1000. Unlimited repetitions are not subject to this restriction.

|&nbsp;| Possessive repetitions |
| --- | --- |

| x++ | one or more x, possessive (NOT SUPPORTED) |
| x?+ | zero or one x, possessive (NOT SUPPORTED) |

| s | let . match \n (default false) |
| U | ungreedy: swap meaning of x\* and x\*?, x+ and x+?, etc (default false) |

Flag syntax is `xyz` (set) or `-xyz` (clear) or `xy-z` (set `xy`, clear `z`).
