# Microsoft Edge Lifecycle Policy

This article describes the lifecycle policy that applies to Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Stable channel version 94, Microsoft Edge moved to a 4-week major release cycle cadence. However, we recognize that enterprise customers who manage complex environments need more time to plan and test Microsoft Edge updates. To help our enterprise customers who need an extended timeline to manage updates, Microsoft Edge offers an **Extended Stable option aligned to a longer, 8-week major release cycle.** This release option is only available for customers with managed environments. [Refer to our announcement blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/07/15/opt-in-extended-stable-release-cycle/)

## Overview of the lifecycle policy for Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge features more frequent and more flexible updating capabilities. Because browser releases aren't bound to the Windows major releases, it's necessary to have the governing lifecycle policy updated to reflect this decoupling. Going forward, Microsoft Edge follows the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy). Security updates and servicing updates are only available on the latest Stable channel release and the latest Beta channel release. If you use older releases of Microsoft Edge, it's likely that you'll miss the latest quality and security updates. Using older versions isn't recommended. Assisted Support is available as described in the following section.

## Service and assisted support timeline

Starting with Stable channel version 94, Microsoft Edge moved to a 4-week major release cycle cadence starting with Stable channel version 94. We continue to provide Assisted Support for the most recent three Stable channel releases and the latest Beta channel release. The effective assisted support duration for a Stable channel release is approximately 12 weeks.

We recognize that enterprise customers who manage complex environments need more time to plan and test Microsoft Edge updates. To help our enterprise customers who need an extended timeline to manage updates, Microsoft Edge offers an **Extended Stable option aligned to a longer, 8-week major release cycle**. Assisted Support is available for the most recent two Extended Stable channel releases. The effective assisted support duration for an Extended Stable channel release is approximately 16 weeks. The following table summarizes the support options for different Microsoft Edge releases.
