Scenarios

The "block alternative browsers" state will be consistent across all pages that contain the setting. We will not have inconsistent states for this setting. 

When Web Content Filtering is configured in any manner, "block alternative browsers" will be automatically enabled and enforced. Users cannot disable this setting on either page. 

When Web Content Filtering is not configured and the MIP label setting is enabled, "block alternative browsers" will be automatically enabled. Users can choose to disable "block alternative browsers" if desired and will see a warning notice if they choose to do so. 

When Web Content Filtering is configured in any manner, "block alternative browsers" will be automatically enabled and enforced on both the Web Content Filtering and MIP label setting pages. Users cannot disable this setting on either page. --->
