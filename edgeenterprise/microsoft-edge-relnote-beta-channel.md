### Feature updates

- **Changes to Kyber.** The Kyber algorithm has been standardized with minor technical changes and renamed to the Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM). ML-KEM has been implemented in the BoringSSL cryptography library, which allows for it to be deployed and utilized by services that depend on this library.

  The changes to the final version of ML-KEM make it incompatible with the previously deployed version of Kyber. Due to the incompatibility the following changes in Edge will be made:

  - Edge will switch from supporting Kyber to ML-KEM.
  - Edge will offer a key share prediction for hybrid ML-KEM (codepoint 0x11EC).
  - The `PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled` flag and the [PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#postquantumkeyagreementenabled) policy will apply to both Kyber and ML-KEM.
  - Edge will no longer support hybrid Kyber (codepoint 0x6399).

## Version 131.0.2903.27: November 4, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

## Version 131.0.2903.14: October 28, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

## Version 131.0.2903.9: October 24, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues, Dev channel updates, feature updates, site compatibility impacting changes, and policy updates.

### Feature updates

- **Cancel dialog for `beforeunload` event.** Microsoft Edge has changed the behavior of the cancel dialog for the `beforeunload` event. Calling `event.preventDefault` in a `beforeunload` event handler won't prevent the dialog from being shown. Instead, `event.returnValue = ''` needs to be called in the `beforeunload` event handler to prevent the cancel dialog. The [BeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies?branch=pr-en-us-4908#beforeunloadeventcancelbypreventdefaultenabled) policy is obsolete and no longer works after Microsoft Edge version 130.

- **Get the latest updates effortlessly with instant update.** Instant update in Microsoft Edge ensures you get the latest browser updates automatically, when you step away from your computer. You can keep browsing, knowing that you already have the latest updates to keep you safe online. For more information, see [Get instant updates in Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/get-instant-updates-in-microsoft-edge-4820adad-dd32-470c-9bd9-dba1de71a7f1). **Note:** This feature is in private preview for enterprise customers. Future feature updates will be available via Microsoft Edge release notes.

### Site compatibility impacting changes

- **CSS Anchor Positioning: `anchor-scope`.** The `anchor-scope` property allows limiting the visibility of anchor names to a given subtree.

- **CSS `font-variant-emoji`.** The `font-variant-emoji` CSS property provides a way to control between colored (emoji-style) and monochromatic (text-style) emoji glyphs. This method can be also done by adding an emoji Variation Selector, specifically U+FE0E for text and U+FE0F for emoji, after each emoji codepoint.

- **CSS highlight inheritance.** With CSS highlight inheritance, the CSS highlight pseudo-classes, such as `::selection` and `::highlight`, inherit their properties through the pseudo highlight chain, rather than the element chain. The result is a more intuitive model for inheritance of properties in highlights.

- **Improvements to styling structure of `<details>` and `<summary>` elements.** Support more CSS styling for the structure of `<details>` and `<summary>` elements to allow these elements to be used in more cases where disclosure widgets or accordion widgets are built on the web. In particular, this change removes restrictions that prevented setting the display property on these elements, and adds a `::details-content` pseudo-element to style the container for the part that expands and collapses.

- **`@page` margin boxes.** Add support for page margin boxes, when printing a web document, or exporting it as PDF.

  The `@page` margin boxes let you define the contents in the margin area of a page, for example to provide custom headers and footers, rather than using the built-in headers and footers generated by the browser.

  A margin box is defined using an at-rule inside a CSS `@page` rule. The appearance and the contents of a margin box are specified with CSS properties inside the `@page` rule, including the `content` property. Counters are also supported, for page numbering. The specification defines two special counter names: `page` for the current page number and `pages` for the total number of pages.

- **@property support `<string>` syntax.** Support for `<string>` syntax component name for registered custom properties.

- **Support `currentcolor` in relative color syntax.** Allow relative colors in CSS (using the `from` keyword) to use `currentcolor` as a base. This lets you set complementary colors, based on an element's text color, for that element's borders, shadows, or backgrounds.

  This feature also includes use cases where color functions are nested with a dependency on `currentcolor`, for example: `color-mix (in srgb, rgb(from currentcolor r g b), white)) or rgb(from rgb(from currentcolor 1 g b) b g r)`.

- **Support external SVG resources for `clip-path`, `fill`, `stroke`, and `marker-*` properties.** This feature adds support for external references for clip paths, markers, and paint servers (for the `fill` and `stroke` properties). For example, `clip-path: url("resources.svg#myPath")`.

- **Direct Sockets API.** Allows Isolated Web Apps to establish direct transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP) communications with network devices and systems as well as listen to and accept incoming connections.

- **Exempt `Speculation-Rules` header from CSP restrictions.** Updates the integration between speculation rules and CSP so that CSP only applies to `<script type=speculationrules>`, and not to the `Speculation-Rules` header. CSP's script policies are meant to protect against injection of scripts into HTML, and the CSP threat model doesn't relate to HTTP headers. This approach allows easier deployment of speculation rules from CDNs and other edge servers.

- **FedCM as a trust signal for the Storage Access API.** Reconciles the FedCM and Storage Access APIs by making a prior FedCM grant a valid reason to automatically approve a storage access request.

  When a user grants permission to use their identity with a third-party identity provider (IdP) on a relying party (RP), many IdPs require third-party cookies to function correctly and securely. This proposal aims to satisfy that requirement in a private and secure manner by updating the Storage Access API (SAA) permission checks to not only accept the permission grant given by a storage access prompt, but also the permission grant given by a FedCM prompt.

  A key property of this mechanism is limiting the grant to cases explicitly allowed by the RP with the FedCM permissions policy, enforcing a per-frame control for the RP and preventing passive surveillance by the IdP beyond the capabilities that FedCM already grants.

- **COOP value `noopener-allow-popups`.** Some origins can contain different applications with different levels of security requirements. In those cases, it can be beneficial to prevent scripts running in one application from being able to open and script pages of another same-origin application.

  In such cases, it can be beneficial for a document to ensure its opener can't script it, even if the opener document is a same-origin one. The `noopener-allow-popups` Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy value lets documents define that behavior.

- **Select parser relaxation.** This change makes the HTML parser allow more tags in `<select>` besides `<option>`, `<optgroup>`, and `<hr>`.

  This change is in support of the customizable `<select>` feature but is being shipped first because it can be done separately and has some compat risk.

- **WebGPU: Clip distances.** Adds the optional GPU feature `clip-distances` that allows setting user-defined clip distances in vertex shader outputs. This technique is useful for the applications that need to clip all vertices in a scene that are beyond a user-defined plane, such as many CAD applications.

- **WebGPU: `GPUCanvasContext getConfiguration()`**. Once `GPUCanvasContext configure()` is called with a configuration dictionary, the `GPUCanvasContext getConfiguration()` method can be used to check the canvas context configuration. It includes GPU `device`, `format`, `usage`, `viewFormats`, `colorSpace`, `toneMapping`, and `alphaMode` members. As discussed in [issue 4828](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4828), web apps can use it to detect whether HDR canvas is supported in WebGPU.

- **WebHID on dedicated workers.** Enables WebHID inside dedicated worker contexts. This lets the performance of heavy I/O and processing of data from a HID device on a separate thread, helping to reduce the performance impact on the main thread.

- **WebRTC `RTCRtpEncodingParameters.scaleResolutionDownTo`.** An API that configures WebRTC encoders to scale input frames if they're greater than the specified `maxWidth` and `maxHeight`. This API is similar to `scaleResolutionDownBy` except that resolution constraints are expressed in absolute terms (for example, 640x360) as opposed to relative terms (for example, scale down by 2), avoiding race conditions related to changing input frame size on the fly.

- **Remove the CSS Anchor Positioning property `inset-area`.** With the CSS Working Group resolution on renaming the `inset-area` property to `position-area`, this removal cleans up the implementation for a standards compliant feature.

- **Remove non-standard GPUAdapter `requestAdapterInfo()` method.** The WebGPU Working Group decided it was impractical for `requestAdapterInfo()` to trigger a permission prompt so they've removed that option and replaced it with the GPUAdapter `info` attribute so that web developers can get the same `GPUAdapterInfo` value synchronously.

### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Beta channel release. These notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2808.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2808-0-is-live/m-p/4237117)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2821.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2821-1-is-live/m-p/4242634)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2835.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2835-2-is-live/m-p/4250520)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2849.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2849-1-is-live/m-p/4255515)

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that prevented the briefcase icon from appearing on the *edge://settings/sidebar* page when Edge Bar was disabled using the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled) policy.  

### Announcement

- **Live Captions.** The [LiveCaptionsAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#livecaptionsallowed) policy was available since Microsoft Edge version 103 but this feature isn't generally available. Clients that have the [ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#experimentationandconfigurationservicecontrol) policy set to 'FullMode' might receive the feature before broad availability. Broad availability will be announced via Microsoft Edge release notes.

### Feature updates

- **Token Binding.** Token Binding uses cryptographic certificates on both ends of the TLS connection in an attempt to close the security gap of bearer tokens, which may be lost or stolen. Token Binding is deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 130. Also, the [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy is now obsolete.

- **Edge on macOS now seamlessly opens links in Teams.** When you set the default browser to Microsoft Edge on macOS and enable the feature, web links from the Teams desktop app are sent via chats, channels, calendar, and other entry points. These links seamlessly open automatically in the profile signed into Teams app and skips the need to reauthenticate in the browser. This feature makes it faster and easier to access content. Administrators can control the availability of this feature using the "Choose Which Browser Opens Web Links" Microsoft 365 policy. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Elevating top settings and improving settings page navigability.** To make finding browser settings more efficient, Microsoft Edge is introducing three navigation improvements to Edge Settings. We aren’t changing the functionality of any setting, and all the settings stay on the same page as they are today but will be behind clickable sections. These changes are as follows.

  - Introduce quick access to the most used Settings actions on the first place users land when entering Edge Settings (the Profiles page). Clicking the button with the name of the setting navigates users directly to its location.

  - Make densely populated Settings pages (such as *Privacy, search, and services*, *Appearance*, *Cookies and site permissions*, *System and performance*) easier to navigate by introducing quick access to the most used actions located on that page. Clicking the button with the name of the setting takes users directly to its location.

  - For these densely populated pages, each lengthy section of settings will be a clickable "table of contents" with descriptive subtexts. This helps users locate settings directly and avoid unnecessary scrolling.

  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Site compatibility impacting changes

- **CSS Container Queries flat tree lookup.** The specification for container queries changed to look up flat tree ancestors. This change is only relevant for shadow DOM where an element will now be able to see non-named containers inside shadow trees into which the element or one of its ancestors is slotted, even if the CSS rule doesn't use `::part()` or `::slotted()`.

- **CSS Nesting: The nested declarations rule.** Keeps bare declarations following a nested rule in their place, by wrapping those declarations in `CSSNestedDeclarations` rules during parsing.

- **Full and unprefixed box-decoration-break support.** Adds support for `box-decoration-break:clone` both for inline fragmentation (line layout) and block fragmentation (pagination for printing and multicol).

  Previously, only `box-decoration-break:slice` (the initial value) was supported for block fragmentation, whereas for inline fragmentation, `box-decoration-break:clone` was also supported, but only when using the `prefixed -webkit-box-decoration-break` property.

- **Allow more pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes after ::part().** CSS selectors that use the `::part()` pseudo-element are allowed to have other CSS pseudo-elements (except `::part()`) and many types of other CSS pseudo-classes after them. Combinators are still not allowed after `::part()`, and pseudo-classes that depend on tree structure aren't allowed.

  Previously only a limited set of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements after `::part()` was allowed. This change allows all of the pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements that should be allowed. It means selectors such as `::part(part-name):enabled` and `::part(part-name)::marker` are now allowed.

- **Compression dictionary transport with shared Brotli and shared Zstandard.** This feature adds support for using designated previous responses, as an external dictionary for content encoding compressing responses with Brotli or Zstandard.

  Enterprises might experience potential compatibility issues with enterprise network infrastructure that intercepts HTTPS traffic and is sensitive to unknown content encodings. The enterprise policy [CompressionDictionaryTransportEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#compressiondictionarytransportenabled) is available to turn off the compression dictionary transport feature.

- **Concurrent smooth scrollIntoView().** The [scrollIntoView()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) method with behavior: "smooth" lets developers create scroll containers that scroll to their descendants with a gentle scroll animation. This feature fixes the implementation of the API so that ongoing scrollIntoView animations aren't canceled by unrelated scrolls on other scroll containers.

  The feature also fixes cases where Edge fails to scroll to a page's fragment anchor because of a competing scrollIntoView that is invoked when the page loads.

- **Document picture-in-picture: add option to ignore window bounds cache.** This change adds a new parameter (`preferInitialWindowPlacement`) to the document picture-in-picture API that, when set to true, hints to the user agent that it shouldn't try to reuse the position or size of the previous document picture-in-picture from this site when opening this one.

  Often, a document picture-in-picture window closes and reopens multiple times for the same site, such as moving a video conference to and from PiP. The user agent is free to reopen the PiP window at its most recent size and location, so that it stays where the user last moved it and provides continuity between the PiP windows. However, if the new window is semantically unrelated to the previous window, such as if it's a new video call, then the developer can use this parameter to provide a hint to the user agent that this window might be better opened in its default position and size instead.

- **Improved error reporting in IndexedDB for large value read failures.** Change to reporting for certain error cases that were previously reported with a DOMException and the message "Failed to read large IndexedDB value."

  Now a DOMException is raised with the name "NotFoundError" when the file containing the data being read by an IDBRequest is missing from the disk so that sites can take the appropriate corrective action when an unrecoverable failure occurs. Corrective actions could include deleting the entry from the DB, notifying the user, or re-fetching the data from servers.

- **Keyboard focusable scroll containers.** This feature makes scrollers without focusable children keyboard-focusable by default.

  This is an important improvement to help make scrollers and contents within scrollers more accessible to all users. Keyboard focusable scrollers are enabled by default starting in version 130.

  If more time is needed to implement this feature, the [KeyboardFocusableScrollersEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#keyboardfocusablescrollersenabled) policy is available starting with Edge 128.

- **Support non-special scheme URLs.** Previously, the URL parser didn't support non-special URLs. The parser parses non-special URLs as if they had an "opaque path," which isn't aligned with the URL Standard. Now, the URL parser parses non-special URLs correctly, following the URL Standard.

  See [bit.ly/url-non-special](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LjxHl32fE4tCKugrK_PIso7mfXQVEeoD1wSnX2y0ZU8/edit?resourcekey=0-d1gP4X2sG7GPl9mlTeptIA#heading=h.voahsyj6c2dh) for more details.

- **WebAssembly JavaScript String Builtins.** This feature exposes common JavaScript string operations for import into WebAssembly. This lets you create and manipulate JavaScript strings from WebAssembly without support within WebAssembly. This still allows for a similar performance as supported string references.

- **WebGPU: Dual source blending.** Adds the optional GPU feature "dual-source-blending" that enables combining two fragment shader outputs into a single framebuffer. This technique is useful for applications that require complex blending operations, such as those based on Porter-Duff blend modes. By reducing the need for frequent pipeline state object changes, dual source blending can enhance performance and flexibility.

- **Web Serial: connected attribute and RFCOMM connection events.** This feature adds a boolean `SerialPort.connected` attribute. The attribute returns true if the serial port is logically connected. For wired serial ports, a port is logically connected if the port is physically attached to the system. For wireless serial ports, a port is logically connected if the device hosting the port has any open connections to the host.

  Previously, only wired serial ports dispatched connect and disconnect events. With this feature, Bluetooth RFCOMM serial ports dispatch these events when the port becomes logically connected or disconnected.

  This feature is intended to allow applications to detect when a Bluetooth RFCOMM serial port is available without opening the port.

- **Remove expectedImprovement in DelegatedInkTrailPresenter.** The expectedImprovement attribute tells web developers how much improvement the DelegatedInkTrails API will provide to their current ink latency. However, this attribute isn't worth the increase to fingerprinting entropy.

- **Deprecate non-standard GPUAdapter requestAdapterInfo() method.** The `requestAdapterInfo()` asynchronous method in WebGPU is redundant because developers can already get GPUAdapterInfo synchronously using the GPUAdapter info attribute.

### Policy updates

#### Obsoleted policies

- [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) - Configure the list of sites for which Microsoft Edge will attempt to establish a Token Binding with (obsolete).
