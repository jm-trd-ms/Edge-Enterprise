# Microsoft Edge language support

This article shows how you can use Microsoft Edge settings to add a supported language to the browser. Microsoft Edge supports 84 display languages on Windows and 81 display languages on macOS.

## Add a supported language to Microsoft Edge

Use the following steps to see the list of supported languages and then add a language to Microsoft Edge.

1. On the browser menu bar, click the **Settings and more** icon (**...**) or type **Alt** + **F** to open the "Settings and more" menu.
2. Under **Settings**, click **Languages**.
3. Under **Languages**, click **Add languages** to see the list of languages you can add.
4. In the **Add languages** list, you can search for a language (**Search languages**) or use the scroll bar to find the language you want to add.
5. When you find the language, select the checkbox for the language, and then click **Add**. The language you added appears at the bottom of the list of **Preferred languages** that are already set for Microsoft Edge. Websites you visit appear in the first language in the list that they support.

### Change preferred languages

You can reorder your language preferences, get Microsoft Edge to offer translations, and see Microsoft Edge in a specific language.
To change a language setting, click the ellipsis (**...**) next to the language to open for "More actions".
Depending on the language, you'll see one or more of the following options:

- Display Microsoft Edge in this language.
  - On Windows, select this box and then click **Restart**.
  - On macOS, Microsoft Edge is displayed in the preferred language of your system. You can change the language in **System Preferences>Language & Region**. Restart Microsoft Edge.
- Offer to translate pages in this language. This option is only available if you enable the **Offer to translate pages that aren't in a language you read**.
- Move to the top
- Move up
- Remove

> [!NOTE]
> You can also set up spellcheck options (**Check Spelling**) based on your preferred language settings.

## Foreign language translator extension

In addition to using a foreign language in the browser, you can use the [Translator for Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/p/translator-for-microsoft-edge/9nblggh4n4n3) extension to translate foreign language web pages and text selections for more than 60 languages.

> [!NOTE]
> If the translator extension doesn't work after installation, restart Microsoft Edge. If the extension still doesn't work, provide feedback through the Feedback Hub.

## Supported display languages

The following table lists the display languages that Microsoft Edge supports.

> [!NOTE]
> Languages that aren't supported by Microsoft Edge on macOS are indicated by an asterisk (*) after the country/region.
