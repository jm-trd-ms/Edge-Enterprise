# Provision favorites for Microsoft Edge

Based on customer feedback, we've made improvements to provisioning favorites. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 85, Admins no longer have to manually craft a file to provision favorites. Admins can add favorites and folders using the Microsoft Edge UI to generate a file that can be exported to a group policy.

This article describes how to provision a set of favorites and folders for your organization. You can use the [Configure favorites](microsoft-edge-policies.md#configure-favorites) policy to provision favorites and folders.

## Prerequisites and recommendations

- Microsoft Edge version 85 with the appropriate administrative template installed for group policies.
- We recommend that you use a new profile in Microsoft Edge to provision these favorites. All favorites that are saved with the profile will be included in the export.  

## Provision favorites and folders

Use the following steps to provision favorites and folders for your users.

1. Go to the Microsoft Edge address bar and type this URL: *edge://flags/#edge-favorites-admin-export*.

2. Under **Favorites configuration export for administrators**, pick **Enabled** from the dropdown list and then select **Restart**.

3. Go to the **Favorites** page at *edge://favorites* so you can add the favorites and folders that you want to provision.

4. When you finish adding favorites and folders you'll export them so they can be used by the **Configure favorites** policy. Go to the address bar and navigate to *edge://favorites*, select the ellipsis "**â€¦**" and choose **Export favorites configuration**. The next screenshot shows the options you have when provisioning favorites.

5. Under **Export your favorites configuration** you provide a name for the folder that your users will see. Type the Folder name and pick the Platform format you want to use. Select **Copy to clipboard**. The next screenshot shows "Managed favorites" for the folder name and the platform is Windows.
